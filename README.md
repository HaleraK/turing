# turing

I created this for course work (discrete mathematics)

This programm decodes the binary code using method Turring

One bit is encoded by three bits, since the code can be damaged due to interference during transmission
When the code is received, it is decoded according to the following scheme, if 2 or 3 bits (0 or 1) are equal, then we write this bit (0 or 1)

For example, like this 
110 000 010 101 111 -> 1 0 0 1 1
